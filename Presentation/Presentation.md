## About (cont'd)

* Designed to be lightweight, utilize other languages other leaning wholly on python itself

### Python vs. Node

<!-- ![api-call-diagram](images/Webhook-api.gif) -->

- Python is best utilized for data driven instances, although can be used for many other things
    - Handy for dealing with other languages
- Node is best suited as a web server
    - mostly focused on javascript use
- No core libraries for node

### Python vs. Node (cont'd)

* Package Management: Npm - PIP / PYPI
* project metadata: package.json - requirements.txt
* Curly Brackets - Tabs
* 2009 - 1991

# Presenter Notes

- [info on requirements.txt](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html)

Example: 

`MyApp`
`Framework==0.9.4`
`Library>=0.2`
